["SONIYA PATEL DESIGN PORTFOLIO September 2016 - Current Soniyaspatel34@gmail.com 908-514-0908 ","Our first deliverable for the project was to create a simple linear drive. This was a smaller project assigned before the completion the final project of a 3-axis drive. A requirement of the project was to make sure the linear drive could be disassembled and put back together by a novice. Also, the linear drive must be able to switch from a belt to a lead screw, accomplished by designing a motor mount that can be rotated 90 degrees and a base plate which can fit either a lead screw or a belt. After completion of the linear drive we moved on to the Calligraphy machine ( 3-axis drive). We then decided our objects. Machine Objectives: Save time Machine that can work like a hand (90 degrees) Can adapt to different fonts Can be used for education/hobbyist Worked with a team of 5 to create a 3-axis machine. Our machine would be used to create calligraphy. We were given 80-20 bars to use for our design frames, so we needed to take this in account when we were designing parts, which caused some problems. An example of this was when we were designing the pen holder for the ","StreetSmart At Boston University the senior design projects are broken up by major. All departments but MechE have a half year to complete projects. My project was to join a Electrical/Computer department team to manufacture a housing system for their electronics Problem Statement: Proposed system will track the amount of snow and ice in certain areas, to permit Boston resources to be deployed more wisely. Having to join a team after they had completed a semester of work was interesting because they had developed an idea of what they what wanted the final housing to be. The first sketch is one of the initial drawings given to me, some of the features they designed were not feasible due to manufacturing and knowledge of processes limitations. The schematic on the right are the constraints I discovered about the electronics. Three components needed to be on the outside of the box while three components needed to be fully enclosed. The LIDAR sensor needed to be able to “view” outside while connecting to the internal components. After some discussion this was the final design. The smaller box was designed to rotate while the overall housing would hold the solar panel and another box made for housing electronics in extreme climates. Some skills I learned from this project were how to communicate with people from different backgrounds as well as explaining more technical processes to people without the same experiences as I had. If I had more time to change the design I would mold the entire outside structure as one piece. Another change I would make is to make the whole system sleeker by using smaller boxes for the electronics. ","Organic clay model to 3D Print First I used clay wrapped around a wrench to create an imprint. After letting the clay air-dry I then tried to scan the model but was not successful in capturing the entire model in one scan as the 3D scanner claimed I would have been able too. With these multiple scans I had to manually align them using Mesh Mixer. Next time I try to scan an organic model I will be sure to do more research in how to use the 3D scanner properly. After creating the final mesh file I had to import the mesh into SOLIDWORKS in order to add the missing geometry. Then I imported the part file back into Mesh Mixer to create the final smoothed grip. The final design was printed hollow using an SLA printer. Cons • Took a long time • Expensive equipment • Need to use multiple software programs Pros • Custom grip to use for multiple projects • Software can only get better • Better clay models can lead to better scans ","Recreating CAT scan geometry Current Project Project: Creating a life sized model from a CT scan to correctly train medical professors on the usage of a flexible laryngoscope Using a free open source software called 3D Slicer I trying to separated the important geometry for the laryngoscope. My file is ready to print however we are facing difficulties in trying to find a printer that will be able to print the complex geometry with varying thicknesses I am learning how to design for additive through this process, we might have to make some sacrifices in the design to be able to print out a usable model. Hopefully these issues get resolved soon.

To the left is our first design which we now have to redesign because we are unable to thread the cap and tube since the diameter is 3 inches. Our new design will implement a pin and lock system instead. This project is teaching us how much thought is put into designing even just a simple toy and how much documentation needs to happen to keep track of all the changes between a project team. The team is now working on a resign of the cap and for the center plates where the liquid needs to flow. [To be continued…] Our team’s initial sketches "]
